# Case Study 01: Basic Token Model

This case study explores a simple hypothetical Web3 token model
to highlight common design decisions and potential risks.

The goal is not to predict price, but to analyze incentive alignment
and long-term sustainability.

---

## Assumptions

- Fixed maximum supply
- Linear token emissions
- Multiple stakeholder groups
- Early-stage network growth

---

## Token Allocation (Example)

- Community & Ecosystem: 40%
- Team & Contributors: 20%
- Investors: 20%
- Treasury & Operations: 20%

This distribution aims to balance growth, incentives, and long-term support.

---

## Emissions & Inflation

Tokens are released gradually through a linear emission schedule.
While simple, this approach can introduce sustained inflation pressure
if demand does not grow proportionally.

---

## Incentive Risks

- Early participants may extract value quickly
- Linear emissions may not adapt to usage
- Misalignment between short-term rewards and long-term goals

---

## Key Takeaways

Simple token models are easy to understand but often fail
to account for real user behavior.

Designing incentives that adapt over time is critical for sustainability.
